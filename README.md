Override stars by attributing a score to a review using NLP.

Sometimes, a customer's review can be unclear, a comment may not reflect the rating (ex. five-stars method). This phenomenon can be explained by various reasons such as the fact that this scoring method depends of the client personnality (is a 3/5 score a good score or not ?). To override these rating methods, we work on a way to attribute a score based directly on the analysis of a comment. This project is based on sentiment analysis using NLP.
